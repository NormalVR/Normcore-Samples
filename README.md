# Versions
* Unity LTS - 2022.3.37f1
* Normcore 2.10.4
* OpenXR plugin
* Built-in renderer (not URP or HDRP)

# TODO
This file should explain how to install (ex specific Unity version) and open the sample projects.

# TODO
* OpenXR works out of the box
* But you need to specify your input controller types (they call it an interaction profile) in Project Settings
* I've enabled the Quest controller interaction profiles
* Non-Quest users will need to do this step or they won't receive input
	* Document this in this file?
